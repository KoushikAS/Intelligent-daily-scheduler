In this folder we clean the data obtained from the UCL ADL Binary Dataset data set (OrdonezA_ADL). We first convert the txt file to csv in text_to_csv.ipyb.
Then in data_cleaning.ipyb we divide the day into intevals of 15 mins and findout whether the test subject is free or not in this interval.Note we have assumed 
'Spare_Time/TV' as the user being free.
