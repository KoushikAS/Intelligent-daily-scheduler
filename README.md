Intellegent daily scheduler

It is quite evident that everyone have certain objectives to be completed and quite a few
expectations to be met. Accomplishments of these targets requires proper planning in
addition to an individual’s abilities. Smartphones have seen substantial growth over the past
decade and there is perceptible evidence of people relying on them. Although there are
solutions in the form of todo list applications to mitigate the scheduling problem, they
provide little insight regarding an individual’s time organisation. In our application focus is
laid on learning the leisure time of the user by indirectly monitoring day to day activities
through the app. Free time as predicted by the model and the list of tasks to be performed
form the input to the scheduling algorithm. The scheduling algorithm then allocates time for
each task and the user is notified of the final schedule.
