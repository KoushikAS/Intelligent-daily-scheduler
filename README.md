Intellegent daily scheduler

It is quite evident that everyone has certain objectives to be completed and quite a few expectations to be met. Accomplishments of these targets require proper planning in addition to an individual's abilities. Smartphones have seen substantial growth over the past decade and there is perceptible evidence of people relying on them. Although there are solutions in the form of to-do list applications to mitigate the scheduling problem, they provide little insight regarding an individual's time organization. Most of the existing applications just provide the feature of recording the tasks and users themselves need to set the time at which these tasks have to be executed. In our application focus is laid on learning the leisure time of the user by indirectly monitoring day to day activities through the app. Free time as predicted by the model and the list of tasks to be performed together form the input to the scheduling algorithm. The scheduling algorithm then allocates time for each task ensuring load balancing by evenly distributing the tasks across the week and the user is notified of their personalized final schedule.
